            If you're looking for a TV series that will keep you on the edge of your seat, look no further than
            Hannibal. This show is a masterpiece of psychological horror, with brilliant performances, stunning visuals,
            and a captivating plot. Hannibal is based on the novels by Thomas Harris, and follows the complex
            relationship between FBI profiler Will Graham and the notorious serial killer Hannibal Lecter. The show
            explores themes of morality, identity, and madness, as Will and Hannibal engage in a twisted game of cat and
            mouse. Hannibal is not for the faint of heart, as it features some of the most gruesome and creative murders
            ever seen on TV. But it also has moments of dark humor, romance, and friendship, that make you care for the
            characters, even when they do terrible things. The show has a loyal fan base, who have been campaigning for
            a fourth season ever since it was cancelled in 2015. Hannibal deserves a 5/5 rating, because it is a rare
            example of a TV series that is both intelligent and entertaining, and that challenges the viewers to
            question their own morality and sanity.
