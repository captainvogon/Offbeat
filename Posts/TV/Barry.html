            Barry manages to subvert many clichés and tropes of the action
            genre, and surprise the viewers with unexpected twists and turns. The show also explores themes such as
            morality, guilt, trauma, ambition, and self-deception in a realistic and compelling way. The show does not
            shy away from showing the consequences of Barry's actions, and how they affect him and those around him.
        </p>
        <p>
            The acting is superb. Bill Hader, who plays
            Barry, delivers a nuanced and layered performance that shows his range as an actor. The supporting cast is
            also amazing, especially
            Henry Winkler as Gene and Anthony Carrigan as the classic Noho Hank, Barry's friendly rival in the criminal
            underworld.
        </p>

            The show creates a distinct visual style that matches the tone of the
            story. Some episodes
            are especially memorable for their creative direction, such as "ronny/lily", which features an epic fight
            scene between Barry and a martial arts expert.
        </p>

            Bill Hader really outdid himself with this one. 5/5.
