            Bojack Horseman is not your typical cartoon. It tackles serious issues like depression, addiction, trauma,
            and self-loathing with honesty and humor. It also features some of the most memorable characters and voice
            actors in TV history, such as Will Arnett as Bojack, Alison Brie as Diane, Aaron Paul as Todd, and Amy
            Sedaris as Princess Carolyn. The show is full of witty dialogue, clever references, and hilarious jokes that
            will keep you entertained and engaged.</p>

            But what makes Bojack Horseman truly stand out is its emotional depth and complexity. The show does not shy
            away from showing the dark side of fame, Hollywood, and human (or animal) nature. It explores the themes of
            identity, morality, and redemption with nuance and sensitivity. It makes you care about the characters, even
            when they do terrible things. It makes you feel their pain, their joy, and their hope. It makes you think
            about your own life and what matters to you.</p>

            The running jokes are some of the most creative and side-splitting ones I've ever seen in a show. 5/5.
