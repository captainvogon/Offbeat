            Rick and Morty is full of witty humor, creative sci-fi concepts, and dark themes that explore the meaning of
            life, morality, and free will.</p>
        <p>
            The show doesn't shy away from showing the consequences of Rick's actions, which can be devastating for him,
            his family, and the entire universe. The show balances its serious moments with hilarious jokes and
            references that poke fun at pop culture, science, and human nature.</p>
        <p>
            The show is not perfect, though. Some episodes can be too chaotic or absurd for some tastes, and some
            characters can be annoying or underdeveloped. The only real problem I had with this show was the number of
            seasons. When a show is not planned out till the end and goes on ad-libbing for too long, there's bound to
            be continuity errors, and it is apparent that Rick and Morty has experienced a significant decline in
            quality over the course of its sixth season.</p>

        <p>
            Overall, Rick and Morty is a brilliant and original TV series. It's not for
            everyone, but if you enjoy smart comedy, sci-fi adventure, and existential drama, then you should give it a
            try. 4/5.
