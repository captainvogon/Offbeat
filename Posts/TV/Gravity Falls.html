            Of all the shows I've seen, Gravity Falls boasts the remarkable achievement of continuity throughout both
            its seasons. After you've seen it once, I recommend you go back and watch it again: there are lots of
            instances of foreshadowing and you'll see the show in a whole different light.

            Gravity Falls is truly a monument of storytelling, animation, and humor. The show balances comedy and
            drama, mystery and fantasy. The characters are lovable and relatable, each with their own flaws and
            strengths. The plot is engaging and unpredictable. The animation is stunning and colorful, with a style that
            suits the tone and setting of the show. There are lots of secrets to be discovered in the show, too: for
            example, there are ciphers hidden in the opening sequence of every episode.</p>

            Best show I've seen since Bojack Horseman, and more than half as kid-friendly. 5/5.
