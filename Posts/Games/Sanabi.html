            Before playing it, I thought Sanabi was just another Katana Zero ripoff. It's not.
        </p>
        <p>
            The game is downright gorgeous. The cyberpunk pixel art style is crisp and clear, and there is so much
            detail and effort put into the world that you can just stop and stare at the game if you wish to.
        </p>

        <p>
            Sanabi has a wonderful plot too, do note that the game is in early access for now so the plot is unfinished
            (something I found out the hard way, there's nothing more devastating than being invested in a story and
            then finding out it's not done yet).
        </p>
        <p>The platforming handles very well. The grapple hook makes the movement feel smooth and fluid. The levels
            provide a fair challenge. Some of the harder levels may take a few tries, but the game never gets tedious or
            repetitive.
        </p>
        <p>
            The music is remarkably good, with both cheerful melodies and electronic beats. It should be illegal for
            this game to be under $15, but it is.
        </p>

            Good game. 5/5.
