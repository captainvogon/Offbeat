            I haven't had this much fun playing a game in a long time.
        </p>

        <p>
            OTXO, pronounced 'ot-cho', is a roguelite top-down shooter. I don't usually see roguelites to the end, but I
            was able to
            complete OTXO within
            just 4 or 5 runs.
        </p>
        <p>
            The black, white and red pixel art looks great and the sound design is also very good. The visual feedback
            when you kill an enemy is excellent. The bosses present a fair challenge but if you use the bullet time to
            dodge attacks, you should have
            no problem beating them. The bartender where you get your upgrades in the form of drinks is a nice touch,
            and I
            also like that the game lets you pick what guns you can use; the catch is that your enemies will use the
            same guns you select.
        </p>
        <p>
            The movement speed is a bit slow, and the rolls don't feel quite as smooth as they should be; Nevertheless,
            OTXO still provides adrenaline rush-inducing gameplay that feels fluid for the most part.
        </p>

        <p>The music is phenomenal. The electronic breakbeats really lend themselves well to the intense gameplay. Very
            good game for around $15.

            Also, the sniper rifle makes you feel like a god. 4/5.
