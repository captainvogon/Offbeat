            Bleak Sword is a pixelated mesh of action, adventure, and agony. You play as a lone
            warrior who must fight his way through hordes of enemies, traps, and bosses in a dark and gloomy world. The
            game is simple to control, but hard to master.</p>
        <p> You can slash, dodge, parry, and counterattack with just a
            few buttons, but timing is everything. One wrong move and you're dead. And trust me, you will die. A lot.
        </p>
        <p>
            The game is brutally difficult, to the point of being repetitive. I felt like I was playing through the same
            level for an eternity, and then I realised I could just go back to the easier levels, grind to upgrade my
            stats and come back. I don't like when games do this because it incentivizes you to replay the same levels
            over and over, which makes for a very tedious experience. </p>
        <p>The game's graphics are minimalist but stylish, with a retro aesthetic that fits the mood of the
            game. The game's music and sound effects are also excellent, creating a tense and immersive atmosphere.
            For those who love a good challenge, it's a
            must-play.
        </p>

        <p>For 10$, it's worth a try. 3/5.</p>
