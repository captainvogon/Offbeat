        <p>If you ever wanted to unleash your inner gorilla and go on a rampage of destruction, then Ape Out is the game
            for you. The game is simple but satisfying: you can either grab and
            throw your enemies, or push them into walls. The graphics are minimalist but
            stylish, with bright colors and dynamic lighting.</p>
        <p> The game's soundtrack is also amazing, with jazz drums
            that sync with your actions and create a sense of tension and chaos. Each chapter of the game is presented
            as a vinyl album. Since the music is procedurally generated by you splattering the humans around, this
            makes for quite an interesting piece of music.</p>

        <p>Ape Out is not a very long game, but it offers plenty of replay value with different modes and levels. </p>

        <p>Ape Out is a game that will make you feel powerful and exhilarated, but also frustrated. The game
            is not easy, and you will die a lot. Some of the napalm levels actually seemed near-impossible to me, and it
            did
            take a lot of tries to beat them. This is my only complaint about the game. (I promise I'm good at video
            games, I beat Dark Souls)</p>
        <p>The game is also full of humor and absurdity, as you witness the
            carnage and chaos you cause with your ape antics. The game does not take itself too seriously, and neither
            should you.</p>

        <p>Ape Out is a game that I recommend to anyone who likes action games, or anyone who just wants to have
            some fun and blow off some steam. The levels towards the end may get pretty difficult. Just remember to take
            breaks.</p>
        <p>
            Me Like. 3/5.
