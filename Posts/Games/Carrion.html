            I never thought about being a blob of flesh and tentacles that escapes from a secret lab and wreaks havoc on
            unsuspecting humans, but this game made me want to.</p>
        <p> Carrion is a reverse horror game where you
            play as the monster and hunt down the people who experimented on you. You can grow bigger, unlock new
            abilities, and explore different areas of the facility. The game is a lot of fun, especially if you enjoy
            gore and chaos.</p>
        <p> The graphics are pixelated but detailed, the sound effects are squishy and satisfying, and
            the gameplay mechanics are smooth and responsive. The only downside is that there is no
            map or objective system, so you might get lost or confused at times.
        </p>
        <p>
            Carrion is a bit generic in terms of gameplay. I loved the flashbacks that explain the back-story, but for
            the
            most part you're only fighting the same enemies and it can get quite repetitive sometimes. Still, I'd say
            this is a good game overall and for only around $15, it's a steal.
        </p>

            This game really makes you <i>feel</i> like a blob of flesh and tentacles. 3/5.
