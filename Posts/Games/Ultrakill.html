            Ultrakill is easily second on my top FPS games of all time, right on the heels of DOOM. Ultrakill was the
            game that got me back into the FPS genre just when there weren't many good indie shooter games out there.
        </p>

        <p>
            The gameplay in this game is intense and breakneck. You get health by showering yourself with the blood of
            your enemies. You never have a moment to stop and think about what
            you're
            going to kill next, it just flows. A big part of this can be attributed to the masterful level design and
            the choice of weapons provided to you.
        </p>

        <p>
            Music is always a major part of all good games, and Ultrakill is no exception. The game's soundtrack is one
            of the best I've heard in a while, and it's almost unbelievable that Hakita (the developer) made
            most of the
            music himself. The breakbeat genre really fits well into the gameplay, and the albums for Act 1 and Act 2
            contain many iconic songs you may remember from your playthrough.
        </p>

        <p>
            Some of the bosses are pretty challenging, but they are doable once you figure out that
            changing weapons often and always moving is the key to staying alive. The game's movement mechanics run
            surprisingly deep if
            you wish to learn them, which provides incentive for players to replay the game at a harder difficulty once
            they finish their first playthrough.
        </p>

            The PS1-type graphics may seem unappealing to some players at first, but don't let that deter you. The
            gameplay and music more than make up for it. The world
            is very detailed, and there are always secrets if you wish to find them.
        </p>

        <p>After you've played the game once, I recommend checking out the Cyber Grind mode. I usually don't enjoy
            "endless wave" modes in games, but Ultrakill does it very well with the morphing terrain and the variety of
            enemies.
