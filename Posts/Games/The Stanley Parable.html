            The Stanley Parable is a game that defies all expectations and
            conventions of gaming. It is a game that plays with you.
        </p>
        <p>

            The Stanley Parable is a game that makes you question everything you know about games. It is a game that
            breaks the fourth wall, mocks clichés, subverts tropes, and surprises you at every turn. It is a game that
            makes you laugh, think, and wonder. It is a game that is not really a game at all.</p>
        <p>

            The Stanley Parable is a game that you have to experience for yourself. It is a game that cannot be
            described, only played. It is a game that will change the way you look at games forever. Try staying in the
            broom closet for 20 minutes and you'll see what I mean.</p>

            The Stanley Parable is a game that I highly recommend to anyone who loves games, or anyone who hates them.
            This game shouldn't be under $10, but it is. 5/5.
