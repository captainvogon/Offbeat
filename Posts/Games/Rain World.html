            I have mixed feelings about this game. On the one hand, it's pixel art is magnificent. On the other hand,
            its difficulty means most players will quit before getting through most of the game, even with a
            guide.
        </p>
        <p>
            The feeling of being lost in an alien world in Rain World is something no game has ever made me
            feel before. Rain World is procedurally animated, meaning every animal has a mind of its own and you can
            even observe some animals eating others right before your eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
            The AI is scarily good and makes the animals
            and plants come to life. You can find a stunning level of realism; there are established food chains in
            every region and the upshot of all this is that you never feel like the hero. In Rain World, you're the one
            being hunted, and the game teaches you via countless deaths that fighting predators is usually a bad idea.
        </p>

        <p>If you play Rain World, I suggest not playing more than two hours at a time, lest you get frustrated. The is
            a truly unique game and I believe every platformer lover should at least try it. 4/5.</p>
