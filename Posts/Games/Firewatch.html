            Firewatch is a game that tries to be a lot of things. It's a game about exploring a beautiful wilderness,
            but you can't really go anywhere you want. It's a game about choices and consequences, but your choices
            don't really matter in the end. It's a game about mystery and suspense, but the mystery is disappointing and
            the suspense is artificial.</p>
        <p>
            And still, I find myself recommending this game to my friends. Maybe it's the stunning graphics and the
            gorgeous landscapes. Maybe it's the heartwarming story which is masterfully crafted except for the ending,
            which feels shallow and hastily put together.
        </p>
        <p>

            Firewatch should not have been a game, but an interactive novel. The
            gameplay is boring and repetitive. But the voice acting is impressive and well done.

            Firewatch is $15, and at
            that price I would say it's worth a try. You just might like it. 3/5.
