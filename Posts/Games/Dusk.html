            If you're looking for a retro-inspired shooter that will make you feel like a badass, look no further than
            Dusk. Dusk is a game that pays homage to the classics of the 90s, such as Doom, Quake, and Blood, but with
            modern sensibilities and a wicked sense of humor. I always love lovecraftian horror, and Dusk is the game
            that does it best. The polygonal visuals make the
            sprites look terrifying.</p>
        <p>
            The music is, of course, phenomenal. Andrew Hulshult always does an awesome job on his soundtracks, and Dusk
            is no exception. The metal riffs coupled with the eerie synths really amp up the horror aspect of the game.
        </p>

            But Dusk is primarily a shooter, and this is another area it excels at. The movement is fast and responsive,
            and the weapons have a certain 'punch' to them that's always appreciated in the FPS genre. The bosses are
            fair, and not too difficult.
        </p>
        <p>
            Dusk is a game that deserves your attention, if you're a fan of fast-paced action, gory violence, and
            dark humor. It's a game that I highly recommend, and one that I will never forget.

            If you pick up the soap next to the toilets and throw it at enemies, it one-shots everything. Even bosses.
            5/5.
