            Following (1998) is full of twists and turns that will keep you guessing until the end. The plot is
            nonlinear, jumping back and forth in time, and the characters are unreliable narrators who may or may not be
            telling the truth.</p>
        <p> The movie is shot in black and white, giving it a gritty and realistic feel. The acting is superb,
            especially by Jeremy Theobald, who plays the protagonist, and Alex Haw, who plays the thief. The movie is
            also very low-budget, costing Christopher Nolan only $6,000 to make, but it doesn't show in the quality of
            the film. The movie
            is a masterpiece of storytelling and filmmaking, and I highly recommend it to anyone who loves a good
            mystery.

            It's one of those movies you have to watch more than once to fully appreciate. And trust
            me, you'll want to watch it again. 4/5.
