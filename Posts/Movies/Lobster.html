            The Lobster is a masterful blend of dark comedy and dystopian satire. It's a movie that challenges the
            conventions of romance, society and human nature.</p>
        <p>
            The Lobster is not a movie for everyone. It's quirky, absurd and sometimes disturbing. It questions the
            norms and expectations that society imposes on us. It shows us the cruelty of both extremes: the pressure to
            find a partner and the rejection of any emotional connection.</p>

        <p>
            The Lobster is a movie that stays with you long after you watch it. It's a movie that makes you appreciate
            the complexity and diversity of human relationships. It's a movie that makes you wonder what animal you
            would choose to be if you had to. 4/5.
